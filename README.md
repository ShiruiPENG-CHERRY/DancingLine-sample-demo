# DancingLine-sample-demo
Dancing Line is a rhythm-based game where players guide a continuously moving line (or other shapes like squares or dots) along a predefined path. The essence of the game lies in its synchronization with music: the rhythm dictates when the line needs to turn, and the player's timely clicks execute these turns. Failure to turn at the right moment, or colliding with the environment, results in a loss.
